Choose a download method, the author provides a lot, choose a suitable one for you to download, open the Odin flashing tool, put the phone into coal digging mode (shut down and press the volume down, power button and home button), press the volume up, and then connect the mobile phone to the computer, and the odin will output the port.

Then go to the twrp [official website](twrp.me) to download the third-party recovery of the mobile phone, and then flash it.

⚠️*Critical step: After flashing the phone, it will restart. When restarting, immediately press the volume up button and the power button and the home button. Here is an explanation: because Samsung has added some verification mechanisms, after flashing the rec, you must manually enter the rec. Otherwise, the rec will be replaced by the original rec, and it will be for nothing, so this step is necessary. After entering the rec, you can choose your language.

Swipe the slider to enter the rec main page. After entering the main page, click install, you will find that the internal storage is 0mb, because the data is encrypted, you need to return at this time, click clear, format the data and enter yes, then the data will have capacity.
